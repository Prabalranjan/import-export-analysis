In this project, I have analyzed the import and export data of India from various countries from 1989 to 2022. 
I have collected the data from 'WORLD INTEGRATED TRADE SOLUTION'. (link above)

I have analyzed 'overall trade trades', 'Trade Balance', 'Product-wise Analysis', 'Country-wise Analysis', 'Percentage Share Analysis', '

**TRADE BALANCE -** 
Trade balance refers to the difference between the value of a country's exports (goods and services it sells to other countries) and its imports (goods and services it buys from other countries) over a specific period, typically a month or a year.
When a country exports more than it imports, it has a trade surplus, indicating that it's selling more abroad than it's buying from other countries. Conversely, when a country imports more than it exports, it has a trade deficit, meaning it's buying more from other countries than it's selling.


**WHAT IS HS6 CODE?**
it is a standardized international classification system for products used in global trade. Each product is assigned a unique code simply to make the whole process easy.



**INSIGHTS**



**Export-** /n

Over the years, our export numbers have generally been on the rise, indicating a growing economy and expanding international trade activities. However, there are noticeable cycles of growth and slowdowns, with periods of rapid export expansion followed by slower growth or slight declines. For example, there was a significant increase in exports from 2004 to 2008, but then a dip during the global financial crisis in 2009, before recovering again. Major economic events like the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have had significant impacts on export volumes, as seen in the fluctuations around those years. These events highlight the sensitivity of our export performance to broader economic conditions and global events.


**Import-** /n
The import data reveals a consistent upward trend over the years, indicating a growing demand for foreign goods and services. Similar to exports, there are noticeable cycles of growth and slowdowns in import volumes, with periods of rapid expansion followed by slower growth or slight declines. Notably, there was a significant increase in imports from 2004 to 2008, followed by a dip during the global financial crisis in 2009, before resuming an upward trajectory. Major economic events such as the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have had significant impacts on import volumes, underscoring the sensitivity of import performance to broader economic conditions and global events. This increasing trend in import volumes also suggests a growing dependency on foreign goods and services, which can have implications for domestic industries, trade balances, and economic stability.


**Trade Relationship-**

**Trade Surplus:** The United States, Hong Kong, China, United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates are the top 5 countries with which India has a trade surplus. This means that the value of India's exports to these countries is greater than the value of its imports from them.


**Trade Deficit:** China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany and Belgium are the top 5 countries with which India has a trade deficit. This means that the value of India's imports from these countries is greater than the value of its exports to them.
Overall, India has a trade surplus with some of its major trading partners but also has a trade deficit with others. This highlights the importance of India's diversification of its trade partners to reduce its reliance on countries with which it has a trade deficit.
